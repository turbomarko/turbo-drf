## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to do all the work.

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/turbomarko/turbo-drf

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

**Warning**: After this point, change 'Mark Hoffman', 'turbomarko', etc to your own information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired [options](http://turbo-drf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/project-generation-options.html). For example::

    project_name [Project Name]: Reddit Clone
    project_slug [reddit_clone]: reddit
    description [Behold My Awesome Project!]: A reddit clone.
    author_name [Mark Hoffman]: Mark Hoffman
    domain_name [example.com]: myreddit.com

Enter the project and take a look around::

    $ cd reddit/
    $ ls

Create a git repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:turbomarko/redditclone.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README.
